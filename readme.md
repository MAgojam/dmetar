> **NOTE:** This is a read-only repository. For questions concerning the **dmetar** package, or to report bugs,
please contact us via [mail](https://github.com/MathiasHarrer/dmetar/tree/master#questions--bugs).


The **dmetar** package serves as the companion R package for the guide
[**Doing Meta-Analysis in
R**](https://bookdown.org/MathiasHarrer/Doing_Meta_Analysis_in_R/) by
Mathias Harrer, Pim Cuijpers, Toshi Furukawa and David Daniel Ebert. The
package contains utility functions to facilitate the conduction of
meta-analyses using the **meta**, **metafor**, **netmeta** and **gemtc**
packages.



## Installation

The latest development version can be installed from **GitHub** using [**remotes**](https://remotes.r-lib.org/).

``` r
if (!require("remotes")) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github("MathiasHarrer/dmetar")
```



## Learning More

The **dmetar** package was developed for the online guide **Doing
Meta-Analysis in R** by Mathias Harrer, Pim Cuijpers, Toshi Furukawa and
David Daniel Ebert. This guide gives an introduction on how
meta-analyses can be conducted in R, with a focus on biomedical and
psychological research.

The guide was designed to serve as a low-threshold entry point for
researchers who want to learn about meta-analysis using R. **No prior
knowledge of R or RStudio is required**. The guide provides a more
detailed overview of **dmetar** functions and how they can be used in
combination with go-to meta-analysis packages such as **metafor** or
**meta**.
